      "The Only God",
      "We all believe in our hearts and confess with our mouths that there is a single and simple spiritual being, whom we call God\u2014 eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, unchangeable, infinite, almighty; completely wise, just, and good, and the overflowing source of all good."

    [
      "The Means by Which We Know God",
      "We know God by two means: First, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe, since that universe is before our eyes like a beautiful book in which all creatures, great and small, are as letters to make us ponder the invisible things of God: God\u2019s eternal power and divinity, as the apostle Paul says in [Romans 1:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A20&version=RSV). All these things are enough to convict humans and to leave them without excuse. Second, God makes himself known to us more clearly by his holy and divine Word, as much as we need in this life, for God\u2019s glory and for our salvation."

    [
      "The Written Word of God",
      "We confess that this Word of God was not sent nor delivered \u201cby human will,\u201d but that \u201cmen and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God,\u201d as Peter says. ([2 Pet. 1:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Pet.+1%3A21&version=RSV)) Afterward our God\u2014 with special care for us and our salvation\u2014 commanded his servants, the prophets and apostles, to commit this revealed Word to writing. God, with his own finger, wrote the two tables of the law. Therefore we call such writings holy and divine Scriptures."

    [
      "The Canonical Books",
      "We include in the Holy Scripture the two volumes of the Old and New Testaments. They are canonical books with which there can be no quarrel at all. In the church of God the list is as follows: In the Old Testament, the five books of Moses\u2014 Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth; the two books of Samuel, and two of Kings; the two books of Chronicles, called Paralipomenon; the first book of Ezra; Nehemiah, Esther, Job; the Psalms of David; the three books of Solomon\u2014 Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song; the four major prophets\u2014 Isaiah, Jeremiah*, Ezekiel, Daniel; and then the other twelve minor prophets\u2014 Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi. In the New Testament, the four gospels\u2014 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; the Acts of the Apostles; the fourteen letters of Paul\u2014 to the Romans; the two letters to the Corinthians; to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians; the two letters to the Thessalonians; the two letters to Timothy; to Titus, Philemon, and to the Hebrews; the seven letters of the other apostles\u2014 one of James; two of Peter; three of John; one of Jude; and the Revelation of the apostle John. * \u201cJeremiah\u201d here includes the Book of Lamentations as well as the Book of Jeremiah."

    [
      "The Authority of Scripture",
      "We receive all these books and these only as holy and canonical, for the regulating, founding, and establishing of our faith. And we believe without a doubt all things contained in them\u2014 not so much because the church receives and approves them as such but above all because the Holy Spirit testifies in our hearts that they are from God, and also because they prove themselves to be from God. For even the blind themselves are able to see that the things predicted in them do happen."
    ],
    [
      "The Difference Between Canonical and Apocryphal Books",
      "We distinguish between these holy books and the apocryphal ones, which are the third and fourth books of Esdras; the books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Jesus Sirach, Baruch; what was added to the Story of Esther; the Song of the Three Children in the Furnace; the Story of Susannah; the Story of Bel and the Dragon; the Prayer of Manasseh; and the two books of Maccabees. The church may certainly read these books and learn from them as far as they agree with the canonical books. But they do not have such power and virtue that one could confirm from their testimony any point of faith or of the Christian religion. Much less can they detract from the authority of the other holy books."
    ],
    [
      "The Sufficiency of Scripture",
      "We believe that this Holy Scripture contains the will of God completely and that everything one must believe to be saved is sufficiently taught in it. For since the entire manner of service which God requires of us is described in it at great length, no one\u2014 even an apostle or an angel from heaven, as Paul says\u2014 ([Gal. 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.+1%3A8&version=RSV)) ought to teach other than what the Holy Scriptures have already taught us. For since it is forbidden to add to the Word of God, or take anything away from it, ([Deut. 12:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut.+12%3A32+&version=RSV), [Rev. 22:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev.+22%3A18-19&version=RSV)) it is plainly demonstrated that the teaching is perfect and complete in all respects. Therefore we must not consider human writings\u2014 no matter how holy their authors may have been\u2014 equal to the divine writings; nor may we put custom, nor the majority, nor age, nor the passage of times or persons, nor councils, decrees, or official decisions above the truth of God, for truth is above everything else. For all human beings are liars by nature and more vain than vanity itself. Therefore we reject with all our hearts everything that does not agree with this infallible rule, as we are taught to do by the apostles when they say, \u201cTest the spirits to see whether they are from God,\u201d ([1 John 4:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A1&version=RSV)) and also, \u201cDo not receive into the house or welcome anyone who comes to you and does not bring this teaching.\u201d ([2 John 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+John+10&version=RSV))"

    [
      "The Trinity",
      "In keeping with this truth and Word of God we believe in one God, who is one single essence, in whom there are three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct according to their incommunicable properties\u2014 namely, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Father is the cause, origin, and source of all things, visible as well as invisible. The Son is the Word, the Wisdom, and the image of the Father. The Holy Spirit is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father and the Son. Nevertheless, this distinction does not divide God into three, since Scripture teaches us that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit each has a distinct subsistence distinguished by characteristics\u2014 yet in such a way that these three persons are only one God. It is evident then that the Father is not the Son and that the Son is not the Father, and that likewise the Holy Spirit is neither the Father nor the Son. Nevertheless, these persons, thus distinct, are neither divided nor fused or mixed together. For the Father did not take on flesh, nor did the Spirit, but only the Son. The Father was never without the Son, nor without the Holy Spirit, since all these are equal from eternity, in one and the same essence. There is neither a first nor a last, for all three are one in truth and power, in goodness and mercy."
    ],
    [
      "The Scriptural Witness on the Trinity",
      "All these things we know from the testimonies of Holy Scripture as well as from the effects of the persons, especially from those we feel within ourselves. The testimonies of the Holy Scriptures, which teach us to believe in this Holy Trinity, are written in many places of the Old Testament, which need not be enumerated but only chosen with discretion. In the book of Genesis God says, \u201cLet us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness.\u201d So \u201cGod created humankind in his image\u201d\u2014indeed, \u201cmale and female he created them.\u201d ([Gen. 1:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.+1%3A26-27&version=RSV)) \u201cSee, the man has become like one of us.\u201d ([Gen. 3:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.+3%3A22&version=RSV)) It appears from this that there is a plurality of persons within the Deity, when God says, \u201cLet us make humankind in our image\u201d\u2014 and afterward God indicates the unity in saying, \u201cGod created.\u201d It is true that God does not say here how many persons there are\u2014 but what is somewhat obscure to us in the Old Testament is very clear in the New. For when our Lord was baptized in the Jordan, the voice of the Father was heard saying, \u201cThis is my Son, the Beloved;\u201d ([Matt. 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+3%3A17&version=RSV)) the Son was seen in the water; and the Holy Spirit appeared in the form of a dove. So, in the baptism of all believers this form was prescribed by Christ: Baptize all people \u201cin the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\u201d ([Matt. 28:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+28%3A19&version=RSV)) In the Gospel according to Luke the angel Gabriel says to Mary, the mother of our Lord: \u201cThe Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God.\u201d ([Luke 1:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A35&version=RSV)) And in another place it says: \u201cThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.\u201d ([2 Cor. 13:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Cor.+13%3A14&version=RSV)) [\u201cThere are three that testify in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one.\u201d([1 John 5:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A7&version=RSV)) In all these passages we are fully taught that there are three persons in the one and only divine essence. And although this doctrine surpasses human understanding, we nevertheless believe it now, through the Word, waiting to know and enjoy it fully in heaven. Furthermore, we must note the particular works and activities of these three persons in relation to us. The Father is called our Creator, by reason of his power. The Son is our Savior and Redeemer, by his blood. The Holy Spirit is our Sanctifier, by living in our hearts. This doctrine of the holy Trinity has always been maintained in the true church, from the time of the apostles until the present, against Jews, Muslims, and certain false Christians and heretics, such as Marcion, Mani, Praxeas, Sabellius, Paul of Samosata, Arius, and others like them, who were rightly condemned by the holy fathers. And so, in this matter we willingly accept the three ecumenical creeds\u2014 the Apostles\u2019, Nicene, and Athanasian\u2014 as well as what the ancient fathers decided in agreement with them."

      [
        "The Deity of Christ",
        "We believe that Jesus Christ, according to his divine nature, is the only Son of God\u2014 eternally begotten, not made or created, for then he would be a creature. He is one in essence with the Father; coeternal; the exact image of the person of the Father and the \u201creflection of God\u2019s glory,\u201d ([Col. 1:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col.+1%3A15&version=RSV), [Heb. 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+1%3A3&version=RSV)) being like the Father in all things. Jesus Christ is the Son of God not only from the time he assumed our nature but from all eternity, as the following testimonies teach us when they are taken together. Moses says that God created the world; ([Gen. 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.+1%3A1&version=RSV)) and John says that all things were created through the Word, ([John 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A3&version=RSV)) which he calls God. The apostle says that God created the world through the Son. ([Heb. 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+1%3A2&version=RSV)) He also says that God created all things through Jesus Christ. ([Col. 1:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col.+1%3A16&version=RSV)) And so it must follow that the one who is called God, the Word, the Son, and Jesus Christ already existed before creating all things. Therefore the prophet Micah says that Christ\u2019s origin is \u201cfrom ancient days.\u201d ([Mic. 5:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mic.+5%3A2&version=RSV)) And the apostle says that the Son has \u201cneither beginning of days nor end of life.\u201d ([Heb. 7:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+7%3A3&version=RSV)) So then, he is the true eternal God, the Almighty, whom we invoke, worship, and serve."

        "The Deity of the Holy Spirit",
        "We believe and confess also that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son\u2014 neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but only proceeding from the two of them. In regard to order, the Spirit is the third person of the Trinity\u2014 of one and the same essence, and majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, being true and eternal God, as the Holy Scriptures teach us."

      [
        "The Creation of All Things",
        "We believe that the Father, when it seemed good to him, created heaven and earth and all other creatures from nothing, by the Word\u2014 that is to say, by the Son. God has given all creatures their being, form, and appearance and their various functions for serving their Creator. Even now God also sustains and governs them all, according to his eternal providence and by his infinite power, that they may serve humanity, in order that humanity may serve God. God has also created the angels good, that they might be messengers of God and serve the elect. Some of them have fallen from the excellence in which God created them into eternal perdition; and the others have persisted and remained in their original state, by the grace of God. The devils and evil spirits are so corrupt that they are enemies of God and of everything good. They lie in wait for the church and every member of it like thieves, with all their power, to destroy and spoil everything by their deceptions. So then, by their own wickedness they are condemned to everlasting damnation, daily awaiting their torments. For that reason we detest the error of the Sadducees, who deny that there are spirits and angels, and also the error of the Manicheans, who say that the devils originated by themselves, being evil by nature, without having been corrupted."

        "The Doctrine of God's Providence",
        "We believe that this good God, after creating all things, did not abandon them to chance or fortune but leads and governs them according to his holy will, in such a way that nothing happens in this world without God\u2019s orderly arrangement. Yet God is not the author of, and cannot be charged with, the sin that occurs. For God\u2019s power and goodness are so great and incomprehensible that God arranges and does his works very well and justly even when the devils and the wicked act unjustly. We do not wish to inquire with undue curiosity into what God does that surpasses human understanding and is beyond our ability to comprehend. But in all humility and reverence we adore the just judgments of God, which are hidden from us, being content to be Christ\u2019s disciples, so as to learn only what God shows us in the Word, without going beyond those limits. This doctrine gives us unspeakable comfort since it teaches us that nothing can happen to us by chance but only by the arrangement of our gracious heavenly Father, who watches over us with fatherly care, sustaining all creatures under his lordship, so that not one of the hairs on our heads (for they are all numbered) nor even a little bird can fall to the ground without the will of our Father. ([Matt. 10:29-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+10%3A29-30&version=RSV)) In this thought we rest, knowing that God holds in check the devils and all our enemies, who cannot hurt us without divine permission and will. For that reason we reject the damnable error of the Epicureans, who say that God does not get involved in anything and leaves everything to chance."

        "The Creation and Fall of Humanity",
        "We believe that God created human beings from the dust of the earth and made and formed them in his image and likeness\u2014 good, just, and holy; able by their will to conform in all things to the will of God. But when they were in honor they did not understand it ([Ps. 49:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps.+49%3A20&version=RSV)) and did not recognize their excellence. But they subjected themselves willingly to sin and consequently to death and the curse, lending their ear to the word of the devil. For they transgressed the commandment of life, which they had received, and by their sin they separated themselves from God, who was their true life, having corrupted their entire nature. So they made themselves guilty and subject to physical and spiritual death, having become wicked, perverse, and corrupt in all their ways. They lost all their excellent gifts which they had received from God, and retained none of them except for small traces which are enough to make them inexcusable. Moreover, all the light in us is turned to darkness, as the Scripture teaches us: \u201cThe light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.\u201d ([John 1:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A5&version=RSV)) Here John calls the human race \u201cdarkness.\u201d Therefore we reject everything taught to the contrary concerning human free will, since humans are nothing but the slaves of sin and cannot do a thing unless it is given them from heaven. ([John 3:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A27&version=RSV)) For who can boast of being able to do anything good by oneself, since Christ says, \u201cNo one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who sent me\u201d? ([John 6:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A44&version=RSV)) Who can glory in their own will when they understand that \u201cthe mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God\u201d? ([Rom. 8:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+8%3A7&version=RSV)) Who can speak of their own knowledge in view of the fact that \u201cthose who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of God\u2019s Spirit\u201d? ([1 Cor. 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor.+2%3A14&version=RSV)) In short, who can produce a single thought, knowing that we are not able to think a thing about ourselves, by ourselves, but that \u201cour competence is from God\u201d? ([2 Cor. 3:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Cor.+3%3A5&version=RSV)) And therefore, what the apostle says ought rightly to stand fixed and firm: God works within us both to will and to do according to his good pleasure. ([Phil. 2:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil.+2%3A13&version=RSV)) For there is no understanding nor will conforming to God\u2019s understanding and will apart from Christ\u2019s involvement, as he teaches us when he says, \u201cApart from me you can do nothing.\u201d ([John 15:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A5&version=RSV))"

It is therefore so vile and enormous in God\u2019s sight that it is enough to condemn the human race, and it is not abolished or wholly uprooted even by baptism, seeing that sin constantly boils forth as though from a contaminated spring. Nevertheless, it is not imputed to God\u2019s children for their condemnation but is forgiven by his grace and mercy\u2014 not to put them to sleep but so that the awareness of this corruption might often make believers groan as they long to be set free from the body of this death.

God is merciful in withdrawing and saving from this perdition those who, in the eternal and unchangeable divine counsel, have been elected and chosen in Jesus Christ our Lord by his pure goodness, without any consideration of their works.

And God comforted them, promising to give them his Son, born of a woman, ([Gal. 4:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.+4%3A4&version=RSV)) to crush the head of the serpent, ([Gen. 3:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.+3%3A15&version=RSV)) and to make them blessed."

The Son took the \u201cform of a slave\u201d and was made in \u201chuman form,\u201d ([Phil. 2:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil.+2%3A7&version=RSV)) truly assuming a real human nature, with all its weaknesses, except for sin; being conceived in the womb of the blessed virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit, without male participation. And Christ not only assumed human nature as far as the body is concerned but also a real human soul, in order to be a real human being. For since the soul had been lost as well as the body, Christ had to assume them both to save them both together. Therefore we confess (against the heresy of the Anabaptists who deny that Christ assumed human flesh from his mother) that Christ shared the very flesh and blood of children; ([Heb. 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+2%3A14&version=RSV)) being the fruit of the loins of David according to the flesh, ([Acts 2:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A30&version=RSV)) descended from David according to the flesh; ([Rom. 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+1%3A3&version=RSV)) the fruit of the womb of the virgin Mary; ([Luke 1:42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A42&version=RSV)) born of a woman; ([Gal. 4:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.+4%3A4&version=RSV)) the seed of David; ([2 Tim. 2:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Tim.+2%3A8&version=RSV)) the root of Jesse; ([Rom. 15:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+15%3A12&version=RSV)) descended from Judah, ([Heb. 7:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+7%3A14&version=RSV)) having descended from the Jews according to the flesh; descended from Abraham\u2014 having assumed descent from Abraham and Sarah, and was made like his brothers and sisters, yet without sin.

Thus his divine nature has always remained uncreated, without beginning of days or end of life, ([Heb. 7:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+7%3A3&version=RSV)) filling heaven and earth. Christ\u2019s human nature has not lost its properties but continues to have those of a creature\u2014 it has a beginning of days; it is of a finite nature and retains all that belongs to a real body. And even though he, by his resurrection, gave it immortality, that nonetheless did not change the reality of his human nature; for our salvation and resurrection depend also on the reality of his body. But these two natures are so united together in one person that they are not even separated by his death. So then, what he committed to his Father when he died was a real human spirit which left his body. But meanwhile his divine nature remained united with his human nature even when he was lying in the grave; and his deity never ceased to be in him, just as it was in him when he was a little child, though for a while it did not so reveal itself. These are the reasons why we confess him to be true God and truly human\u2014 true God in order to conquer death by his power, and truly human that he might die for us in the weakness of his flesh."

So God made known his justice toward his Son, who was charged with our sin, and he poured out his goodness and mercy on us, who are guilty and worthy of damnation, giving to us his Son to die, by a most perfect love, and raising him to life for our justification, in order that by him we might have immortality and eternal life."

For it is written that \u201cthe punishment that made us whole\u201d was placed on the Son of God and that \u201cby his bruises we are healed.\u201d He was \u201clike a lamb that is led to the slaughter\u201d; he was \u201cnumbered with the transgressors\u201d ([Isa. 53:4-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isa.+53%3A4-12&version=RSV)) and condemned as a criminal by Pontius Pilate, though Pilate had declared that he was innocent. So he paid back what he had not stolen, ([Ps. 69:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps.+69%3A4&version=RSV)) and he suffered\u2014 \u201cthe righteous for the unrighteous,\u201d ([1 Pet. 3:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Pet.+3%3A18&version=RSV)) in both his body and his soul\u2014 in such a way that when he sensed the horrible punishment required by our sins \u201chis sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.\u201d ([Luke 22:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A44&version=ESV)) He cried, \u201cMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d ([Matt. 27:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+27%3A46&version=RSV)) And he endured all this for the forgiveness of our sins. Therefore we rightly say with Paul that we know nothing \u201cexcept Jesus Christ, and him crucified\u201d; ([1 Cor. 2:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor.+2%3A2&version=RSV)) we \u201cregard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus [our] Lord.\u201d ([Phil. 3:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil.+3%3A8&version=RSV)) We find all comforts in his wounds and have no need to seek or invent any other means to reconcile ourselves with God than this one and only sacrifice, once made, which renders believers perfect forever. This is also why the angel of God called him Jesus\u2014 that is, \u201cSavior\u201d\u2014 because he would save his people from their sins.

        "The Righteousness of Faith",
        "We believe that for us to acquire the true knowledge of this great mystery the Holy Spirit kindles in our hearts a true faith that embraces Jesus Christ, with all his merits, and makes him its own, and no longer looks for anything apart from him. For it must necessarily follow that either all that is required for our salvation is not in Christ or, if all is in him, then those who have Christ by faith have his salvation entirely. Therefore, to say that Christ is not enough but that something else is needed as well is a most enormous blasphemy against God\u2014 for it then would follow that Jesus Christ is only half a Savior. And therefore we justly say with Paul that we are justified \u201cby faith alone\u201d or \u201cby faith apart from works.\u201d ([Rom. 3:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+3%3A28&version=RSV)) However, we do not mean, properly speaking, that it is faith itself that justifies us\u2014 for faith is only the instrument by which we embrace Christ, our righteousness. But Jesus Christ is our righteousness in making available to us all his merits and all the holy works he has done for us and in our place. And faith is the instrument that keeps us in communion with him and with all his benefits. When those benefits are made ours, they are more than enough to absolve us of our sins."

        "The Justification of Sinners",
        "We believe that our blessedness lies in the forgiveness of our sins because of Jesus Christ, and that in it our righteousness before God is contained, as David and Paul teach us when they declare those people blessed to whom God grants righteousness apart from works. ([Ps. 32:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps.+32%3A1&version=RSV), [Rom. 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+4%3A6&version=RSV)) And the same apostle says that we are \u201cjustified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.\u201d ([Rom. 3:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+3%3A24&version=RSV)) And therefore we cling to this foundation, which is firm forever, giving all glory to God, humbling ourselves, and recognizing ourselves as we are; not claiming a thing for ourselves or our merits and leaning and resting on the sole obedience of Christ crucified, which is ours when we believe in him. That is enough to cover all our sins and to make us confident, freeing the conscience from the fear, dread, and terror of God\u2019s approach, without doing what our first parents, Adam and Eve, did, who trembled as they tried to cover themselves with fig leaves. In fact, if we had to appear before God relying\u2014 no matter how little\u2014 on ourselves or some other creature, then, alas, we would be swallowed up. Therefore everyone must say with David: \u201c[Lord,] do not enter into judgment with your servant, for no one living is righteous before you.\u201d ([Ps. 143:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps.+143%3A2&version=RSV))"

        "The Sanctification of Sinners",

Therefore, far from making people cold toward living in a pious and holy way, this justifying faith, quite to the contrary, so works within them that apart from it they will never do a thing out of love for God but only out of love for themselves and fear of being condemned. So then, it is impossible for this holy faith to be unfruitful in a human being, seeing that we do not speak of an empty faith but of what Scripture calls \u201cfaith working through love,\u201d ([Gal. 5:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.+5%3A6&version=RSV)) which moves people to do by themselves the works that God has commanded in the Word. These works, proceeding from the good root of faith, are good and acceptable to God, since they are all sanctified by God\u2019s grace. Yet they do not count toward our justification\u2014 for by faith in Christ we are justified, even before we do good works. Otherwise they could not be good, any more than the fruit of a tree could be good if the tree is not good in the first place. So then, we do good works, but not for merit\u2014 for what would we merit? Rather, we are indebted to God for the good works we do, and not God to us, since God \u201cis at work in [us], enabling [us] both to will and to work for his good pleasure\u201d ([Phil. 2:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil.+2%3A13&version=RSV)) \u2014 thus keeping in mind what is written: \u201cWhen you have done all that you were ordered to do, say, \u2018We are worthless slaves; we have done only what we ought to have done.\u2019\u201c ([Luke 17:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+17%3A10&version=RSV)) Yet we do not wish to deny that God rewards good works\u2014 but it is by grace that God crowns these gifts. Moreover, although we do good works we do not base our salvation on them; for we cannot do any work that is not defiled by our flesh and also worthy of punishment. And even if we could point to one, memory of a single sin is enough for God to reject that work. So we would always be in doubt, tossed back and forth without any certainty, and our poor consciences would be tormented constantly if they did not rest on the merit of the suffering and death of our Savior."

Otherwise we would have no access. But this Mediator, whom the Father has appointed between himself and us, ought not terrify us by his greatness, so that we have to look for another one, according to our fancy. For neither in heaven nor among the creatures on earth is there anyone who loves us more than Jesus Christ does. Although he was \u201cin the form of God,\u201d Christ nevertheless \u201cemptied himself,\u201d taking \u201chuman form\u201d and \u201cthe form of a slave\u201d for us; ([Phil. 2:6-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil.+2%3A6-8&version=RSV)) and he made himself \u201clike his brothers and sisters in every respect.\u201d ([Heb. 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+2%3A17&version=RSV)) Suppose we had to find another intercessor. Who would love us more than he who gave his life for us, even though \u201cwe were enemies\u201d? ([Rom. 5:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+5%3A10&version=RSV)) And suppose we had to find one who has prestige and power. Who has as much of these as he who is seated at the right hand of the Father, ([Rom. 8:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+8%3A34&version=RSV), [Heb. 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+1%3A3&version=RSV)) and who has \u201call authority in heaven and on earth\u201d? ([Matt. 28:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+28%3A18&version=RSV)) And who will be heard more readily than God\u2019s own dearly beloved Son? So, the practice of honoring the saints as intercessors in fact dishonors them because of its misplaced faith. That was something the saints never did nor asked for, but which in keeping with their duty, as appears from their writings, they consistently refused. We should not plead here that we are unworthy\u2014 for it is not a question of offering our prayers on the basis of our own dignity but only on the basis of the excellence and dignity of Jesus Christ, whose righteousness is ours by faith. Since the apostle for good reason wants us to get rid of this foolish fear\u2014 or rather, this unbelief\u2014 he says to us that Jesus Christ was made like \u201chis brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest\u201d to purify the sins of the people. ([Heb. 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+2%3A17&version=RSV)) For since he suffered, being tempted, he is also able to help those who are tempted. ([Heb. 2:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+2%3A18&version=RSV)) And further, to encourage us more to approach him he says, \u201cSince, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\u201d ([Heb. 4:14-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+4%3A14-16&version=RSV)) The same apostle says that we \u201chave confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus.\u201d \u201cLet us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith\u2026.\u201d ([Heb. 10:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+10%3A19&version=RSV), [Heb. 10:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+10%3A22&version=RSV)) Likewise, Christ \u201cholds his priesthood permanently\u2026. Consequently, he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.\u201d ([Heb. 7:24-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb.+7%3A24-25&version=RSV)) What more do we need? For Christ himself declares: \u201cI am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\u201d ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&version=RSV)) Why should we seek another intercessor? Since it has pleased God to give us the Son as our Intercessor. let us not leave him for another\u2014 or rather seek, without ever finding. For, when giving Christ to us, God knew well that we were sinners. Therefore, in following the command of Christ we call on the heavenly Father through Christ, our only Mediator, as we are taught by the Lord\u2019s Prayer, being assured that we shall obtain all we ask of the Father in his name."

And this holy church is preserved by God against the rage of the whole world, even though for a time it may appear very small to human eyes\u2014 as though it were snuffed out.

And to preserve this unity more effectively, it is the duty of all believers, according to God\u2019s Word, to separate themselves from those who do not belong to the church, in order to join this assembly wherever God has established it, even if civil authorities and royal decrees forbid and death and physical punishment result.

But we are speaking of distinguishing the body and fellowship of the true church from all sects that call themselves \u201cthe church.\u201d The true church can be recognized if it has the following marks: The church engages in the pure preaching of the gospel; it makes use of the pure administration of the sacraments as Christ instituted them; it practices church discipline for correcting faults. In short, it governs itself according to the pure Word of God, rejecting all things contrary to it and holding Jesus Christ as the only Head. By these marks one can be assured of recognizing the true church\u2014 and no one ought to be separated from it. As for those who can belong to the church, we can recognize them by the distinguishing marks of Christians: namely by faith, and by their fleeing from sin and pursuing righteousness, once they have received the one and only Savior, Jesus Christ. They love the true God and their neighbors, without turning to the right or left, and they crucify the flesh and its works. Though great weakness remains in them, they fight against it by the Spirit all the days of their lives, appealing constantly to the blood, suffering, death, and obedience of the Lord Jesus, in whom they have forgiveness of their sins, through faith in him. As for the false church, it assigns more authority to itself and its ordinances than to the Word of God; it does not want to subject itself to the yoke of Christ; it does not administer the sacraments as Christ commanded in his Word; it rather adds to them or subtracts from them as it pleases; it bases itself on humans, more than on Jesus Christ; it persecutes those who live holy lives according to the Word of God and who rebuke it for its faults, greed, and idolatry.

So they are not empty and hollow signs to fool and deceive us, for their truth is Jesus Christ, without whom they would be nothing.

        "We believe and confess that Jesus Christ, in whom the law is fulfilled, has by his shed blood put an end to every other shedding of blood, which anyone might do or wish to do in order to atone or satisfy for sins. Having abolished circumcision, which was done with blood, Christ established in its place the sacrament of baptism. By it we are received into God\u2019s church and set apart from all other people and alien religions, that we may wholly belong to him whose mark and sign we bear. Baptism also witnesses to us that God, being our gracious Father, will be our God forever. Therefore Christ has commanded that all those who belong to him be baptized with pure water \u201cin the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\u201d ([Matt. 28:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+28%3A19&version=RSV)) In this way God signifies to us that just as water washes away the dirt of the body when it is poured on us and also is seen on the bodies of those who are baptized when it is sprinkled on them, so too the blood of Christ does the same thing internally, in the soul, by the Holy Spirit. It washes and cleanses it from its sins and transforms us from being the children of wrath into the children of God. This does not happen by the physical water but by the sprinkling of the precious blood of the Son of God, who is our Red Sea, through which we must pass to escape the tyranny of Pharaoh, who is the devil, and to enter the spiritual land of Canaan. So ministers, as far as their work is concerned, give us the sacrament and what is visible, but our Lord gives what the sacrament signifies\u2014 namely the invisible gifts and graces; washing, purifying, and cleansing our souls of all filth and unrighteousness; renewing our hearts and filling them with all comfort; giving us true assurance of his fatherly goodness; clothing us with the \u201cnew self\u201d and stripping off the \u201cold self with its practices.\u201d ([Col. 3:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col.+3%3A9-10&version=RSV)) For this reason we believe that anyone who aspires to reach eternal life ought to be baptized only once without ever repeating it\u2014 for we cannot be born twice. Yet this baptism is profitable not only when the water is on us and when we receive it but throughout our entire lives. For that reason we reject the error of the Anabaptists who are not content with a single baptism once received and also condemn the baptism of the children of believers. We believe our children ought to be baptized and sealed with the sign of the covenant, as little children were circumcised in Israel on the basis of the same promises made to our children. And truly, Christ has shed his blood no less for washing the little children of believers than he did for adults. Therefore they ought to receive the sign and sacrament of what Christ has done for them, just as the Lord commanded in the law that by offering a lamb for them the sacrament of the suffering and death of Christ would be granted them shortly after their birth. This was the sacrament of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, baptism does for our children what circumcision did for the Jewish people. That is why Paul calls baptism the \u201ccircumcision of Christ.\u201d ([Col. 2:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col.+3%3A9-10&version=RSV))"

        "The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper",
        "We believe and confess that our Savior Jesus Christ has ordained and instituted the sacrament of the Holy Supper to nourish and sustain those who are already regenerated and ingrafted into his family, which is his church. Now those who are born again have two lives in them. The one is physical and temporal\u2014 they have it from the moment of their first birth, and it is common to all. The other is spiritual and heavenly, and is given them in their second birth\u2014 it comes through the Word of the gospel in the communion of the body of Christ; and this life is common to God\u2019s elect only. Thus, to support the physical and earthly life God has prescribed for us an appropriate earthly and material bread, which is as common to all people as life itself. But to maintain the spiritual and heavenly life that belongs to believers, God has sent a living bread that came down from heaven: namely Jesus Christ, who nourishes and maintains the spiritual life of believers when eaten\u2014 that is, when appropriated and received spiritually by faith. To represent to us this spiritual and heavenly bread Christ has instituted an earthly and visible bread as the sacrament of his body and wine as the sacrament of his blood. He did this to testify to us that just as truly as we take and hold the sacrament in our hands and eat and drink it with our mouths, by which our life is then sustained, so truly we receive into our souls, for our spiritual life, the true body and true blood of Christ, our only Savior. We receive these by faith, which is the hand and mouth of our souls. Now it is certain that Jesus Christ did not prescribe his sacraments for us in vain, since he works in us all he represents by these holy signs, although the manner in which he does it goes beyond our understanding and is incomprehensible to us, just as the operation of God\u2019s Spirit is hidden and incomprehensible. Yet we do not go wrong when we say that what is eaten is Christ\u2019s own natural body and what is drunk is his own blood\u2014 but the manner in which we eat it is not by the mouth, but by the Spirit through faith. In that way Jesus Christ remains always seated at the right hand of God the Father in heaven\u2014 but he never refrains on that account to communicate himself to us through faith. This banquet is a spiritual table at which Christ communicates himself to us with all his benefits. At that table he makes us enjoy himself as much as the merits of his suffering and death, as he nourishes, strengthens, and comforts our poor, desolate souls by the eating of his flesh, and relieves and renews them by the drinking of his blood. Moreover, though the sacraments and what they signify are joined together, not all receive both of them. The wicked certainly take the sacrament, to their condemnation, but do not receive the truth of the sacrament, just as Judas and Simon the Sorcerer both indeed received the sacrament, but not Christ, who was signified by it. He is communicated only to believers. Finally, with humility and reverence we receive the holy sacrament in the gathering of God\u2019s people, as we engage together, with thanksgiving, in a holy remembrance of the death of Christ our Savior, and as we thus confess our faith and Christian religion. Therefore none should come to this table without examining themselves carefully, lest by eating this bread and drinking this cup they \u201ceat and drink judgment against themselves.\u201d ([1 Cor. 11:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor.+11%3A29&version=RSV)) In short, by the use of this holy sacrament we are moved to a fervent love of God and our neighbors. Therefore we reject as desecrations of the sacraments all the muddled ideas and condemnable inventions that people have added and mixed in with them.

Then all human creatures will appear in person before the great judge\u2014 men, women, and children, who have lived from the beginning until the end of the world. They will be summoned there \u201cwith the archangel\u2019s call and with the sound of God\u2019s trumpet.\u201d ([1 Thess. 4:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thess.+4%3A16&version=RSV)) For all those who died before that time will be raised from the earth, their spirits being joined and united with their own bodies in which they lived. And as for those who are still alive, they will not die like the others but will be changed \u201cin the twinkling of an eye\u201d from perishable to imperishable. ([1 Cor. 15:51-53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor.+15%3A51-53&version=RSV)) Then the books (that is, the consciences) will be opened, and the dead will be judged according to the things they did in the world, ([Rev. 20:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev.+20%3A12&version=RSV)) whether good or evil. Indeed, all people will give account of all the idle words they have spoken, ([Matt. 12:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+12%3A36&version=RSV)) which the world regards as only playing games. And then the secrets and hypocrisies of all people will be publicly uncovered in the sight of all. Therefore, with good reason the thought of this judgment is horrible and dreadful to wicked and evil people. But it is very pleasant and a great comfort to the righteous and elect, since their total redemption will then be accomplished. They will then receive the fruits of their labor and of the trouble they have suffered; their innocence will be openly recognized by all; and they will see the terrible vengeance that God will bring on the evil ones who tyrannized, oppressed, and tormented them in this world. The evil ones will be convicted by the witness of their own consciences, and shall be made immortal\u2014 but only to be tormented in \u201cthe eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.\u201d ([Matt. 25:41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+25%3A41&version=RSV)) In contrast, the faithful and elect will be crowned with glory and honor. The Son of God will profess their names ([Matt. 10:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+10%3A32&version=RSV)) before God his Father and the holy and elect angels; all tears will be wiped from their eyes; ([Rev. 7:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev.+7%3A17&version=RSV)) and their cause\u2014 at present condemned as heretical and evil by many judges and civil officers\u2014 will be acknowledged as the cause of the Son of God. And as a gracious reward the Lord will make them possess a glory such as the human heart could never imagine. So we look forward to that great day with longing in order to enjoy fully the promises of God in Christ Jesus, our Lord."
